Diff Between SSL, TLS, HTTP, HTTPS -->

HTTP - Hypertext Transerfer Protocol (Transerfer simple text between web to my computer) || Its okay if we don't have any
       Sensitive information (Its traver via public internet)

HTTPS - Secure Hypertext Transerfer Protocol (Transerfer simple text between web to my computer)
        It encrypts the data from Sender to receiver - Using Asymetric Key. (Webserver they do have private Key) 
        in order to encrypts the user information whichj received from the user.
                                             ____
                                             |/\| 
        A lot of web browsers also show the ||  || Lock Sign, In order to indicate its secure.
                                            ||__||

SSL  - Secure Socket Layer, (That uses the security over the internet)

Using SSL, user first send the SSL certificates to Web Browser, once web browsers, Indentifies that he/she is a Valid User,
Then Data Transerfer will be happening via, Our Computer to Webserver.

TSL - Transport Layer Security. 
Also authenticated, client, server and encrypts the data.

Encryption vs Hashing

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sre8D9X1BzE

Encryption  -

1. Symmetric - Same key used to for encoding and decoding (AES Encryption)
2. Asymmetric - Data is decrypted, Using Diff Key. (RSA Algorithm)

Hasing - 

Hashing the userId or Password while storing in the database. 
example - SHA256, MD5 

Note - In case of Encryption it can reversable, Hashing won't. Means Once the text encrypted, 
       It can be decrypted, But in the case of Hashing its not possible.
